1)Start the chat block
2)Define variable count in it
3)If both user send a pic to each other, count=1
4)Capture the exact time stamp and store it in t
5)If both user send pic in less than 24 hrs from t then increment count by 1 
- - another approach ,capture the date when both user send pics for first time and if they send pic within the next day increment count by 1 
6)Else break streak
7)If count <=30 days , place emoji1
If count <=60 days, place emoji2 and so on
8)Close block
